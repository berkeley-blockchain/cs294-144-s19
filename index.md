Blockchain is also one of the most interdisciplinary areas, bringing together new questions and opportunities at the intersection of technology, business and law. This course is designed to employ this interdisciplinary nature. We will provide an overview of the technology behind blockchain and explore current and potential real-world applications in technology, business, and law.

## Class format and project
This is a lecture, discussion, and project oriented class. Each lecture will focus on one of the topics, including a survey of the state-of-the-art in the area and an in-depth discussion of the topic. Each week, students are expected to complete reading assignments before class and participate actively in class discussion.

Students will also form project groups (6 people per group: 2 from EECS, 2 from Haas, 2 from Boalt) and complete a high-impact class project. The final project/deliverable will be small team presentation on a new application of blockchain (with a legal and business analysis). Finally, students will take a final examination that surveys the issues addressed in the course. 

## Laptop and Electronic Device Policy

A mutually supportive learning environment depends on active attention and engagement. For this reason, the use of laptops, tablets, cell phones, or any other electronic device is discouraged during classroom sessions. If you violate this policy without prior approval for an accommodation, you face, at a minimum, a substantial penalization in the class participation portion of your grade.
